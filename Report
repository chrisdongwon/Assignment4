###Prediction and Result

Combination: size 10, 1 cooperator and rest defector:

We predict that the every organism will turn into defector. Defector is more advantageous because it
never give out its energy to others and therefore it can accumulate energy faster than other organisms
and then reproduce faster.

Combination: size 10, 1 defector and rest cooperator

We predict the dual of the previous case, meaning we expect that the entire population
will eventually turn into cooperators. Due to the overwhelming density of cooperators
in the population, we expect reproduction rate to be much higher than the usual and
hence more organisms will be likely be replaced as a new Cooperator in this scenario.

Combination: size 10, 3 cooperator, 3 defector. 4 partial cooperator
Average Cooperation Probability: 0.1

We predicted that defectors will dominate towards the end of the iterations due to the fact that
defectors are more "greedy" versus the cooperators - they will not give out energy unless reproducing.
However, when we saw the results, they were more polarizing: systems ending with all defectors,
and two out of ten trials where the system ended up being all partial cooperator. It appears that
the population gravitates to one "type" or another so far - there is no mix of types, i.e.
nonzero count for the population.

Combination: size 100, 1 cooperator and rest defector
Average Cooperation Probability: 0.0

This is very similar to the very first scenario with population size 10; hence we expected the
same result of everyone eventually defecting. Result appears to be in correlation with our
hypothesis.

Combination: size 100, 1 defector and rest cooperator
Average Cooperation Probability: 1.0

Same as above - we expect the dual of the outcome, and it appears to be so:
everyone eventually cooperates. This is more likely than the systems with smaller
population size due to the cooperator density, i.e. 10% in 1 of 10, vs 1% in 1 of 100.

Combination: size 100, 33 cooperator, 33 defector, 34 partial cooperator

We expected the same outcome for the population size 10 with equal ratio of the different types of
organisms. After the trials, we found that the average cooperation rate to be around 1%, meaning
we had a reasonable guess that the defectors will dominate. This experiment also had polarizing
outcomes where the defectors dominated, but we had one instance where the results
were a mix of defectors and partial cooperators. 

###Summary

It appears that even a small number of defectors introduced in the system can cause the population
to gravitate towards defecting. However, with an overwhelming number of cooperators, it appears
that the system remains cooperative (i.e. average cooperation rate remains high)
even after 100 iterations.
